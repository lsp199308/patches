This guide assumes you're competent enough to atleast have completed the tutorial at Part 1 and Part 2.

1. Extract and/or decompress the update as .nsp so that you have the .nca's it contains. (hactool -t pfs0 "Diablo II Resurrected[0100726014352800][US][v65536].nsp" --outdir=d2r) If it's nsz then figure out how to decompress that. This guide won't cover that.
2. Use hactool on the largest nca container like this (hactool --titlekey=the_key_in_.tik --exefsdir=./ 06828296169b6f96b0123fa7f586d243.nca), you may need a hex editor to view this titlekey if you don't use tools like nxgameinfo_cli ( https://github.com/garoxas/NX_Game_Info ) on the .nsp
3. hactool -t nso0 main --uncompressed=d2r_uncompressed (take note of the buildid, which for version is v65536 32153D9896AE0C7C723F04EC1CE20999CAF7ED69000000000000000000000000)
4. Import it (the uncompressed nso0) into ghidra, load it into ghidra, analyze it. (for a binary this big, it up to 20 minutes on an AMD 5800x processor) If there is an error, just hit "Ok"
5. Open byte mode in ghidra
6. Press S to open memory search, search for "55 73 65 72 20 4C 61 73 74 20 4F 6E 6C 69" ("User Last Online")

7. Right click the string, show references to the address, click the result, that will take you to the function you want.

8. We're patching "MOV W8, WZR" (e8 03 1f 2a) with "NOP" (1f 20 03 d5), that will remove the dumb check that it tries to read.

9. Ghidra will show offset that we want as "1B9970", but it must be corrected to "1B9A70".
10. Use the knowledge gained, Offset, size 4, NOP (translates to 1b 9A 70 00 04 1F 20 03 D5)

11. Save "50 41 54 43 48 1B 9A 70 00 04 1F 20 03 D5 45 4F 46" as 32153D9896AE0C7C723F04EC1CE20999CAF7ED69.ips (version is the exact same offset and patch, before you waste time trying to check. buildid for that is 7E78CC35BAF51EA2907C6C976847207F34F91909)
12. You now have succesfully patched out the d2r online check. (I personally call it d2r_offline_fix) and it can be used with Atmosphere by putting it into /atmosphere/exefs_patches/d2r_offline_fix/32153D9896AE0C7C723F04EC1CE20999CAF7ED69.ips
